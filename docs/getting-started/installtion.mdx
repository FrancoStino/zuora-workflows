description: Step-by-step guide to install Zuora Workflow Manager
---

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Zuora Workflow Manager using Lando.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all [system requirements](/getting-started/requirements) before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone the repository

Clone the GitHub repository to your local system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrancoStino/zuora-workflow-manager.git
cd zuora-workflows
```

If you want to use the `develop` branch:

```bash
git clone -b develop https://github.com/FrancoStino/zuora-workflow-manager.git
cd zuora-workflows
```

## Step 2: Start Lando

Start the Lando environment. This command will automatically download and configure all necessary containers:

```bash
lando start
```

<Note>
    The first start may take several minutes to download the required Docker images.
</Note>

Lando will automatically execute:
- Start containers (PHP 8.4, MariaDB 11.4, Nginx, Redis)
- Run `composer install`
- Configure development environment

Expected output:
```
BOOMSHAKALAKA!!!

Your app has started up correctly.
Here are some vitals:

 NAME            zuora-workflows
 LOCATION        /path/to/zuora-workflows
 SERVICES        appserver, database, cache
 APPSERVER URLS  https://zuora-workflows.lndo.site
```

## Step 3: Environment configuration

Copy the environment variables example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate the Laravel application key:

```bash
lando artisan key:generate
```

## Step 4: Database configuration

Run migrations to create database tables:

```bash
lando artisan migrate
```

Expected output:
```
Migration table created successfully.
Migrating: 0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table
Migrated:  0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table
...
```

<Warning>
    If you receive database connection errors, make sure Lando is started correctly with `lando info`.
</Warning>

## Step 5: Install frontend dependencies

Install frontend dependencies with Yarn. You have two options:

**Option 1: Use Yarn via Lando (recommended)**

This ensures all developers use the same Yarn version and works consistently across all operating systems:

```bash
lando yarn install
```

**Option 2: Use Yarn globally**

If you prefer to use Yarn installed locally on your system:

```bash
yarn install
```

Compile frontend assets:

```bash
yarn run build
```

For development with hot-reload:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

## Step 6: Access the application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
https://zuora-workflows.lndo.site
```

<Note>
    Lando uses HTTPS with self-signed certificates. Your browser may show a security warning. Proceed anyway to access
    the application.
</Note>

## Step 7: Create administrator account

On first access, you will be redirected to the setup page where you can create your administrator account:

1. Enter **Name**
2. Enter **Email**
3. Enter **Password** (minimum 8 characters)
4. Confirm password
5. Click **Create Admin Account**

## Step 8: Start queue worker (optional)

To process background jobs, start the queue worker:

```bash
lando queue
```

This command is equivalent to:
```bash
lando artisan queue:work --verbose
```

<Tip>
    Leave the queue worker running in a separate terminal window during development.
</Tip>

## Step 9: Start scheduler (optional)

To enable scheduled automatic synchronization:

```bash
lando schedule
```

This command is equivalent to:
```bash
lando artisan schedule:work
```

## Verify installation

### Verify Lando services

Check that all services are active:

```bash
lando info
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "appserver": {
    "type": "php:8.4",
    "urls": ["https://zuora-workflows.lndo.site"]
  },
  "database": {
    "type": "mariadb:11.4",
    "creds": {
      "database": "zuora_workflows",
      "user": "zuora_workflows",
      "password": "zuora_workflows"
    }
  },
  "cache": {
    "type": "redis:7.0"
  }
}
```

### Verify database

Access the database to verify tables:

```bash
lando mariadb
```

Run verification query:
```sql
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

### Verify application

Visit the application URL and verify:
- ✅ Login page loads correctly
- ✅ You can login with admin account
- ✅ Filament dashboard is accessible
- ✅ Menu items are visible

## Useful Lando commands

### Application management
```bash
lando start          # Start containers
lando stop           # Stop containers
lando restart        # Restart containers
lando rebuild        # Rebuild containers
lando destroy        # Delete containers
```

### Artisan commands
```bash
lando artisan migrate              # Run migrations
lando artisan migrate:fresh        # Recreate database
lando artisan migrate:fresh --seed # Recreate and seed database
lando artisan tinker               # Interactive REPL
```

### Database
```bash
lando mariadb                      # Access database
lando mariadb zuora_workflows      # Access with specific database
```

### Queue and scheduler
```bash
lando queue                        # Start queue worker
lando schedule                     # Start scheduler
```

### Logs
```bash
lando logs -f                      # View all logs
lando logs -s appserver -f         # PHP container logs
```

### Yarn commands via Lando

You can use Yarn through Lando to ensure consistent behavior across all team members and operating systems.

**Benefits of using Lando Yarn:**
- **Consistent version**: All developers use the same Yarn version
- **Cross-platform**: Works identically on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Isolated**: No need to install Yarn globally on your system
- **No conflicts**: Avoids version conflicts with other projects

**Available Yarn commands:**
```bash
lando yarn install                 # Install frontend dependencies
lando yarn run build               # Compile assets for production
lando yarn run dev                 # Development with hot-reload (HMR)
lando yarn run preview             # Preview production build
```

**Usage example:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
lando yarn install

# Start development server with hot-reload
lando yarn run dev

# Build for production
lando yarn run build
```

<Tip>
    For new contributors, using `lando yarn` is recommended as it guarantees the same environment as other team members.
</Tip>

### Composer
```bash
lando composer install             # Install PHP dependencies
lando composer update              # Update PHP dependencies
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cannot connect to database"

Verify that the database is started:
```bash
lando info
```

Restart Lando if necessary:
```bash
lando restart
```

### Error: "Permission denied"

On Linux, you may need to adjust permissions:
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
```

### Error: "Port already in use"

If port 443 is already in use, modify `.lando.yml`:
```yaml
proxy:
  appserver:
    - zuora-workflows.lndo.site:8443
```

### Cache issues

Clear application cache:
```bash
lando artisan cache:clear
lando artisan config:clear
lando artisan view:clear
```

## Next steps

Now that installation is complete, proceed with configuration:
