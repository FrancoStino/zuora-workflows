### Manual synchronization

You can always synchronize manually:

1. **From UI**: Click "Sync Workflows" in the Customers list
2. **From CLI**: 
   ```bash
   # Synchronize all customers
   lando artisan app:sync-workflows --all
   
   # Synchronize a specific customer
   lando artisan app:sync-workflows --customer="Acme Corp"
   ```

3. Click **Retry** to re-execute the job

### CLI monitoring

Monitor jobs from terminal:

```bash
# View failed jobs
lando artisan queue:failed

# Retry all failed jobs

# Retry a specific job
lando artisan queue:retry {job-id}

# Clear failed jobs
lando artisan queue:flush
```

## 12. Best practices

### Synchronization

- **Automatic**: Use scheduler for regular sync
- **Manual**: Use manual sync only when necessary
- **Monitoring**: Regularly check failed jobs

### Customer management

- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for customers
- **Credentials**: Verify credentials are correct
- **Endpoint**: Use correct endpoint for environment

### Performance

- **Queue worker**: Always keep queue worker active
- **Cache**: Use Redis for cache and queues in production
- **Database**: Monitor database performance

### Security

- **Passwords**: Use strong passwords for users
- **Roles**: Assign only necessary permissions
- **Credentials**: Never share Zuora credentials
- **APP_KEY**: Keep APP_KEY secret

## Common troubleshooting

### Workflows not synchronized

Verify:
1. Zuora credentials are correct
2. Queue worker is active
3. No failed jobs in **Failed Jobs**

### Jobs stuck in queue

Verify:
1. Queue worker active with `lando queue`
2. No errors in logs with `lando logs -f`
3. Database is accessible

### Authentication errors

Verify:
1. Client ID and Secret are correct
2. Base URL is correct for environment
3. Credentials have not expired
