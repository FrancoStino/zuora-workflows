# This file will be populated with Apache Bench results for streaming endpoints

## Test Configuration
- Requests: 50
- Concurrency: 5
- Endpoint: /api/chat/threads/{id}/messages
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: application/json

2. Development server is running
3. Test thread and user exist

## Expected Metrics
- Time per request (mean)
- Requests per second
- Connection Times (min/mean/max/median)
- SSE event delivery latency
- Failed requests: 0

## Command
```bash
ab -n 50 -c 5 -p message.json -T application/json \
   http://localhost:8000/api/chat/threads/123/messages \
