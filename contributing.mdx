3. Set up your development environment (see [Installation](/installation))

## Development workflow

### 1. Fork the repository

Fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zuora-workflows.git
cd zuora-workflows
```

### 2. Create a feature branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-workflow-export`
- `fix/sync-timeout-issue`
- `docs/update-installation-guide`

### 3. Make your changes

Make your changes following the code standards below.

### 4. Test your changes

Run the test suite to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

```bash
lando test
```

### 5. Commit your changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add workflow export feature"
```

Follow conventional commit format:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 6. Push to your fork

```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

### 7. Create a pull request

Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository.

## Pull request guidelines

### Required

- **Document any change in behavior** - Update `README.md` and relevant documentation
- **Create feature branches** - Don't submit pull requests from your master branch
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful

### Optional but recommended

- **Add tests** - Your patch is more likely to be accepted if it includes tests
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Add your changes to the unreleased section

## Code standards

### PHP code style

Follow PSR-12 coding standards. The project uses Laravel Pint for automatic formatting:

```bash
# Check code style
lando composer run pint

# Fix code style automatically
lando composer run pint -- --fix
```

### Laravel conventions

Follow Laravel best practices:

- Use Eloquent ORM for database queries
- Use service classes for business logic
- Use jobs for background processing
- Use events and listeners for decoupled logic
- Use form requests for validation

### Filament conventions

Follow Filament best practices:

- Use resource classes for CRUD operations
- Use custom pages for complex UI
- Use actions for user interactions
- Use widgets for dashboard components

## Testing

### Running tests

```bash
# Run all tests
lando test

# Run specific test file
lando artisan test tests/Feature/SyncWorkflowsTest.php

# Run with coverage
lando artisan test --coverage
```

### Writing tests

Write tests for new features and bug fixes:

```php
test('sync workflows for customer', function () {
    $customer = Customer::factory()->create();
    $service = app(WorkflowSyncService::class);
    
    $stats = $service->syncCustomerWorkflows($customer);
    
    expect($stats)->toHaveKeys(['created', 'updated', 'deleted', 'total']);
    expect($customer->workflows()->count())->toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

## Documentation

### Update documentation

When adding new features or changing behavior:

1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Add code examples where appropriate
3. Update the README.md if necessary
4. Keep documentation concise and clear

### Documentation style

- Use sentence case for headings
- Use second-person voice ("you")
- Use active voice
- Include code examples
- Add notes and warnings where appropriate

## Community

### Get help

- **GitHub Issues** - Report bugs or request features
- **GitHub Discussions** - Ask questions or discuss ideas
- **Pull Requests** - Submit code contributions

### Code of conduct
